###Build an SQL Reference Object

## Overview
This project is a hands-on Git learning exercise where an SQL reference object is built while practicing real development workflows. The goal is to learn Git by actually using it — creating branches, committing changes, resolving conflicts, rebasing history, and managing project files like a real software project.

The SQL reference grows incrementally through commits, demonstrating how version control tracks project evolution.

## Goals
- Learn core Git commands through practical usage
- Understand staging, commits, and repository history
- Use feature and fix branches
- Practice merging and rebasing workflows
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Clean commit history using interactive rebase
- Manage temporary work using stash
- Protect sensitive files using `.gitignore`
